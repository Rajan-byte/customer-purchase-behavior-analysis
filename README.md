# Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis

## Business Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze customer purchasing behavior, identify engagement patterns, and highlight potential churn risks using exploratory data analysis and business rules.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset includes customer demographics, purchase history, and engagement information. The data required cleaning due to missing values, inconsistent records, and incomplete customer activity dates.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Analysis Workflow
- Cleaned and prepared customer data
- Handled missing values and inconsistent categorical entries
- Engineered business-focused features such as customer tenure, recency, and order frequency
- Performed exploratory data analysis across demographics and channels
- Identified churn risk using clear, rule-based logic

## Key Insights
- Customers with recent purchases and higher order frequency show stronger engagement
- In-store customers demonstrate higher churn risk compared to online customers
- A small group of high-spending customers shows early signs of inactivity
- Recency and purchase frequency are strong indicators of customer engagement

## Business Value
This analysis provides actionable insights that can support customer retention strategies, improve engagement tracking, and enable data-driven decision-making without complex modeling.
